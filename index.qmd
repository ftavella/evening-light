title: "Effect of evening light on sleep"
---

# Introduction

Mathematical modeling can help us understand how evening light affects our sleep. Throughout this document we use the [`Skeldon23()`](https://arcascope.github.io/circadian/api/models.html#skeldon23) model from the [`circadian`](https://github.com/Arcascope/circadian) package. The model tells us how the circadian state and sleep homeostat evolve over time. The only input to the model is the light received at each timepoint:

```{python}
#| fig-cap: "Light schedule"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from circadian.lights import LightSchedule

dt = 0.01 # hours
time = np.arange(0, 48, dt)
schedule = LightSchedule.Regular(1000.0, 6.0, 22.0)
light = schedule(time)

plt.plot(time, light)
plt.xlabel('Time (hours)')
plt.ylabel('Light intensity')
plt.show()
```

```{python}
#| fig-cap: "Circadian state"

from circadian.models import Skeldon23
model = Skeldon23()
trajectory = model.integrate(time, input=light)
x = trajectory.states[:, 0]

plt.plot(time, x)
plt.xlabel('Time (hours)')
plt.ylabel('Circadian state (a.u.)')
plt.show()
```
